**reason why I do this:** 
- to start my braincells before large projects

**how to run the game:**

- open terminal or your command line, and run the following command in it:

./a.out
```

- move up, down, right, and left with your your keyboard
- if you want to quit, [ctrl + c] to cancel your running terminal
- **want to discover the code and explaination?** -> see ```main.c```
